# Electron audio & music player

This project is a simple music player designed to be visually immersive when listening on desktop, built on Electron js

> Some wireframes/mockups will be included here

## Features

Features a minimal interface complemented with some visual candy. The app is intended to feature the album art of tracks played & sample them for UI accents, and to help users get album art otherwise. It's not intended to be a fully-featured audio library management & playback tool atm. Some key features below (WIP):

- always-visible album art
- dynamic UI colour accents
- audio waveform
- visualizer
- a small minimal always-on-top mode

## Environment

Dev env (so far):

- Node 14.16.0
- electron 13.1.6
- wavesurfer 5.1.0
- music-metadata 7.11.1
